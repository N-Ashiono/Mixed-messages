# Mixed Messages

## Description

In this project I created a program which delivered a random message when run. 
I decided to use fortunes as the messages that will be produced by the program.

## How to Use
To be able to use the program, first you will need to download [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/). 
After that you simply need to copy the code into node and your fortune will appear at the bottom. 
The process can be repeated by typing in the function. <br>
Alternately using any page in your browser, you can head over to the console in the developer menu then copy and paste the code in there.
